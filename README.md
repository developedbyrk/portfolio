# Python Developer Portfolio – Rajesh Kumar

Welcome to my Python Developer Portfolio!  
This site showcases my journey from a seasoned UI developer to a passionate Python programmer, featuring projects, skills, and contact information.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Senior UI Developer with over 10 years of experience crafting responsive, user-friendly
interfaces using HTML, CSS, and SCSS. Recently, I’ve transitioned into Python development and have
built several beginner to intermediate projects to deepen my understanding. Passionate about clean
code and continuous learning, I’ve also explored Django fundamentals and built a practice project to
expand into backend web development. This portfolio showcases my Python journey and technical
versatility.
